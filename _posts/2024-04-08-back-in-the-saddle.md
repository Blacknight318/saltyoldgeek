The past 10 weeks have been a whirlwind! As many of you know, in addition to my regular work, I coach the Sparta Robotans (Team 8024) FIRST Robotics team. Our competition season reached its peak over the past couple of months, first at the [Central Illinois Regional](https://www.firstillinoisrobotics.org/frc/central-illinois-regional/) two weeks ago followed by the [Seven Rivers Regional](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/WILA) this past weekend. I'm incredibly proud of how hard our students worked and the innovative robot they designed and built.

While the robotics season demanded a lot of my time and focus, I was also able to share some of my technical work at the recent [Brainstorm Conference](https://brainstormk20.com/). I presented on a [WebUI](https://saltyoldgeek.com/posts/anonymize-video-with-deface/?utm_source=internal) frontend I developed for the open source project [deface](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface), which has been receiving great feedback from others looking to leverage its capabilities. The [deface](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface) tool itself blurs faces in video and pictures, and the WebUI I created makes it easier for the average admin to use.

Now that the hectic robotics schedule is behind us, I'm excited to get back to more regular blogging. My next post, which I'm working on currently, will cover performance benchmarks for the latest version of [deface](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface) release as well as new features I'm planning to add to the [WebUI](https://saltyoldgeek.com/posts/anonymize-video-with-deface/?utm_source=internal). This includes support for multi-file uploads, randomized temporary file names for enhanced privacy, and a processing timer to track large jobs.

I appreciate all of you who continue to follow along on this blog despite my occasional extended absences. I have a lot of great content ideas in the pipeline to share over the coming weeks and months. As always, I welcome your feedback, questions, and suggestions for future topics. It's great to be back!
