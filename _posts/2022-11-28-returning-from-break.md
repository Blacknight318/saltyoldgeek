Thanksgiving break has come and gone here in the states, and with the return to school come the tickets, antsy kids, and tired parents, all ready to get back into a routine. During breaks like this, we in IT or Facilities/Buildings and Grounds try to get some of the smaller and/or time-sensitive projects done while no one is around.

Many of the teachers have been busy tweaking their curriculum, entering grades, and prepping for the students' return. For those who were working in between trips to friends and family, or hunting, I'm thankful for you.
