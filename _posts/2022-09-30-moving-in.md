I've finally moved the blog over from Ghost to Jekyll, this should hopefully speed up load times as well as take a little load off from my end. In addition this should make the blog more portable in the event something happens to my server.

The post I originally intended this week should be out by Monday the 3rd of October, 2022. As I finish the post I'll also be working on moving this over to it's new NGINX instance as well(you shouldn't see a change other than some downtime, tbt). Apart from moving over this last week it's also been a training week, of sorts, helping some teachers transition to a new lab and a new way of doing things.... yeah.

Excited about this transition and getting some more stories, parables, and just general writing in.  Till then, fair winds and following seas.
