The question of whether Twiter is going to fail might depend, in part, on your point of view. For those who use Twitter to communicate and feel connected to groups, it may be time to switch to something like Mastodon. However, if you're using like myself, in part to promote this blog, and also for watching new and other organizations, then Twitter will probably remain. Sure it'll be like a dying star, a small dimmer version of itself, but it will most likely carry on. Time will tell.
