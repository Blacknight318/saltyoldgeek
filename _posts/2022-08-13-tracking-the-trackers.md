Reading [this article on Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/this-anti-tracking-tool-checks-if-youre-being-followed/) I decided to comment on it. This article makes some salient points about watching who's tracking you by gathering and analyzing meta data of devices around you, particularly when they seem to move with you.

Many services for many countries have done this for years to detect vessels and aircraft of other nations. The concept is essentially the same, each craft will have a somewhat unique RF pattern associated with them(meta data). This does the same thing, see who's talking to what and pattern match it. Just like each person has patterns and movements so too do their devices. I'll be interested to see how this project matures. Something to think about, have a good day folks.
