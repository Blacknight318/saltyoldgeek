## Intro

Here's a short update on the projects I'm currently working on after a long weekend. This week has been a busy one for me, so I'll keep this brief.

## FRC Week 0 in the books

- The first week of the FIRST Robotics Competition season, known as "FRC Week 0," is a unique event allowing teams to prepare their robots for the upcoming season. Teams are allowed to test out their robots at this time and make final adjustments before they head into their respective regionals.

## Homelab Update
